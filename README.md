# PDF_to_speech_using_Python
To convert a PDF file to text and then to speech in Python, you can use the PyPDF2 library to extract text from the PDF file and the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert the extracted text to speech. 
Replace 'path_to_your_pdf_file.pdf' with the actual path to your PDF file. The script will extract the text from the PDF, convert it to speech using gTTS, save it as an MP3 file named 'output.mp3', and then play the audio file.

Note that the script uses the default language as English (lang='en').
